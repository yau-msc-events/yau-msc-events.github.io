### Dimer models and the two-periodic weighted Aztec diamond

A dimer model is a probability distribution on the set of perfect matchings on a planar graph. Often, we want to study the correlations between dimers, but in general this is a hard problem. However, some progress has been made. It has been shown that there are three distinct phases (solid, liquid and gas) found in dimer models, characterized by the rate of decay of the two-point correlation functions. A dimer model often exhibits more than one of these phases, with distinct boundaries between phases, where some interesting behavior can be found.
 
In this talk, we will give an introduction to dimer models and describe the Kasteleyn solution for computing correlation functions. Then we will give some examples of models with a solid and liquid phase, before introducing the two-periodic weighted Aztec diamond, which is one of the simplest models to exhibit a gas phase. Finally, we will talk about what happens as we shrink the gas region to a point in a specific limit.

This is an introductory talk. No background knowledge is required.
